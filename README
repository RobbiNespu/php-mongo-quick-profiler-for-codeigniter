So the amazing guys at Particletree built this awesome php profiler and I 
thought I would share my mods of integrating it into CI.  My code is a bit
messy/hacky but you should get the idea.  Start by checking out the 
Particletree blog post at http://particletree.com/features/php-quick-profiler/.
Reading through that will give you an idea of what the profiler can accomplish 
and how to log to its console.

So the amazing guys at Particletree built this awesome php profiler and I 
thought I would share my mods of integrating it into CI.  My code is a bit of a
hack job but you should get the idea.  Start by checking out the 
Particletree blog post at http://particletree.com/features/php-quick-profiler/.
Reading through that will give you an idea of what the profiler can accomplish 
and how to log to its console.

3.0 License.


INSTALL:
Get the current version from: 
http://github.com/danmorin/php-quick-profiler-for-codeigniter/tree/master

1) Make sure that hooks are enabled in your application/config/config.php file.

2) Copy the files from the download to the corresponding directories in your 
    application directory.  Make sure you don't overwrite any of your own files
    if you've customized them.  You may need to create the plugins directory 
    under application
    
    app_config      => system/application/config
    app_libraries   => system/application/libraries
    app_plugins     => system/application/plugins
    
3) Once that's done, anywhere you enable the profiler using
    $this->output->enable_profiler(TRUE), you should see the new profiler


NOTES:
 - The plugin is loading using hooks so it can be initialized before most of the
    CI system.  You could autoload it instead, but you'd miss out on a lot of 
    the CI loading process.
    
 - It's not php4 compatible.  If you use php4 still, think of this as a
    fantastic perk you get once you finally upgrade.  Oh and upgrade from
    IE6 while you're at it too please ;)

BUGS:
- images don't currently work correctly
